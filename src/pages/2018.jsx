      <p className="pb-6">We will be hosting a free technology focused Hackathon in honour of Mandela Day on Saturday, the 14th of July (Mandela Day is actually on Tuesday, the 17th of July).</p>
      <p className="pb-6"><strong>We are hoping to building some tools with you in service of the public good. Think basic static hosted HTML websites, tinkering with hardware and/or creating open-source resources for other developers. All projects are welcome as long as they adhere to the following:</strong></p>
